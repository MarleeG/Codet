# Codet
+ We created this app for Development and Programming lovers!
+ Type in your Email and create a Password and then Sign-up.
+ Creating your login credentials will push that information to a database so that your information will be stored for later use.
+ Already an existing user?  Enter your email and password  and then click the Log-in button.
+ Once Logged in, you will be directed to your personal account's home page.
+ On this page, you will be able to make a post and that  post will be shown directly above all of your previous posts to the site.
+ Each one of your posts will be stored in the same database as your login and password.
